The app is storing data in files encoded with AES where key is encoded by MD5;

The main feature is brute forcing passwords in parallel;

Types of brute forcing:

- **Unidirectional**: sort out passwords only in one direction from a to z;
- **Bidirectional**: sort out password in two directions - from a to z and from z to a in one time;
